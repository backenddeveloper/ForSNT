A single page HR application to be shown at interview.

JQuery seems to be the obvious choice for a date-picker application.
The core script is found in the footer.

The task instructions explicitly say no external server access, 
however uncommenting the external CSS link in the header will improve 
the date-picker and prevent errors in the console.

This was written very quickly so please pardon any errors.

All code I have written is released for use under the GNU/GPLv2. Other code included my hold a different license.
NONE of this code is suitable for production use.
