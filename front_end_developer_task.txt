Your task is to create a HTML wizard for a HR web application that allows a user to input staff member details.

The wizard should consist of 2 steps with only one step being displayed at a time.

At the first step the user will enter general staff information which is their name, date of birth and gender.
The user cannot continue to the 2nd step until all fields from the 1st step have been entered and are valid.

At the 2nd step the user will need to enter the staff members payroll number, start date and whether they have first aid training.
Payroll number and start date are required fields. If the staff member has first aid training then an expiry date must also be given.

Upon completing the 2nd step the wizard should simulate sending all staff data to a server by logging the it to the console.
The wizard should not interact with a back end server.
